# hackathon-2-25-23
Wizlet! a project we made as a group for the 2023 REACT Hackathon
100% original definitely did not copy Quizlet... I've never heard of that website.

some example study sets are included in the files. Try using spanish :)
used BufferedReader and FileWriter to save progress in the code itself
runs purely in terminal (we were too lazy to import gui)
